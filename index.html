    Tired of reusing that same old password all over the web?
    Spice it up and get a real strong password!
    Coming in three sizes: L, XL and our favorite XXL.
    </p>
    <h1>Enlarge Your Password!</h1>
    <p>
    Come back each time you need to access this pesky service that
    requires yet another password. Tell your story in the very same way
    (including case and punctuation) and you will get the exact same
    passwords again.
    </p>
    <fieldset id="story">
      <legend>Tell Your Story!</legend>
      <p>
        <label for="service">I want to access</label>
        <input type="text" name="service" autocomplete="off"
          placeholder="Enlarge Your Password" />
        <label for="user">as</label>
        <input type="text" name="user" autocomplete="off"
          placeholder="John Doe" />
        <label for="period">in</label>
        <input type="text" name="period" autocomplete="off"
          placeholder="2011" />.
      </p>
      <p>
        <label for="lamepassword">I want to get rid of my lame password</label>
        <input type="password" name="lamepassword" autocomplete="off"
          placeholder="monkey" />
        to feel warm and fuzzy inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        <label for="openquestion">Future Self, this question is for you:</label>
        “<input type="text" name="openquestion" autocomplete="off"
          placeholder="Is it really you" />?”
        I fear there might be no answer.

    <h3>Hints</h3>
    <p>
    The three passwords above are updated as you type.
    You may fill in as little or as much information as you wish.
    The more specific you get, the strongest the generated passwords will be,
    because it is not all about size you know.
    </p>
    <p>
    You may find useful to double-click the password of your choice to select
    it in full, and copy it using Ctrl+C or drag and drop it to the password
    field of the service that you want to access.

    <p>
    It is a very simple web app, designed for everyday use. The goal is to
    generate a strong password to access a web site by filling in a form with
    simple yet unique information. All inputs are optional and the password is
    generated on the fly, which lets the user choose the level of details to
    get more or less security. The same password is generated consistently for
    the same inputs.
